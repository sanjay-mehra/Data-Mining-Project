**_PROJECT NAME:_  Bengali.AI Handwritten grapheme classification**

## Competition Description
The competition can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19) and detailed description on competition can be found there. The task was a multilabel classification problem: For every image, one of 168 Grapheme Roots, 11 Vowel Diacritics and 7 Consonant Diacritics had to be predicted.
